zsim hooks for different programming languages. Use these to control simulation
(e.g., fast-forwarding). C and C++ programs just need to include zsim-hooks.h.
Fortran programs need to be linked with libfortran-hooks.a. Java programs can
use the provided zsim JNI class. Run make run_tests and explore the Makefile
for more info.
